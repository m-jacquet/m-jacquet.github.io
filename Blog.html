										<h3>Learn now to stay ahead</h3>
										<p>Let's be honnest, programming was not the core skill I learned at university when I studied Industrial Engineer. Yet, I believe now this is such an important skill to develop since in the industry you aim at reducing waste. Repetitive, non value added actions are waste. And although you can physically see the waste on a production line, there are still so many manual actions in Supply Chain Management. Whether it is spending 10 cliks to export a single document or doing endless VLOOKUP on Excel, there is always room for improvement in order to focus more on our core expertise : supply chain management.</p>

										<p>My programming learning journey started then as intern at P&G where I learnt from scratch Excel VBA in order to create tools with a real business impact. Excel VBA has always accompagnied me since in all my work experiences since there are a lot of possibilities while keeping it simple and easily maintenained. Although Excel is a fantastic tool, there are still some limitations and I felt like I needed to step up to open up more impacting possibilities of improvement. I started then to learn Python on my own time which enabled me later on to produce new tools in my work environment.Being interested in reducing non-value added actions to spend more time on analytical tasks, I also started to learn RPA (Robot Process Automation) on UI Path to automate processes that required mutiple interactions with different softwares.</p>

										<p>Not only I enjoy the improvements generated by these new skills but I also enjoy the journey since it is always challenging. That's also why I started to learn web technologies in order to create this website. I also believe it is a fantastic way to show my creativity and share who I am. With no initial knowledge of html and css, I think this website is a reflection of my mindset, always eager to learn new things. So, if you read this article and have an idea about what could be my next challenge, feel free to reach out!</p>
